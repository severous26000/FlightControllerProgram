# Flight Controller Program
This is the code for my flight controller that uses the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope, and NRF24L01P transceiver module.
You can see the PCB design in my other repositories, specifically in the [PCB_Designs repository]([https://github.com/yourusername/PCB_Designs](https://github.com/severous26000/FlightController)).
